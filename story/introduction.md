"Are we really considering this?" Heather asked, her eyes scanning the online listing of a ten-acre wooded plot in Vermont. The image on the screen showed a dense forest with a hint of a structure peeking through—an old mobile home that had seen better days.

"Why not? The world's already upside down. Maybe it's time we flip ours, too," Alan replied, a mix of excitement and uncertainty in his voice.

In the midst of the 2020 pandemic, everything familiar seemed uncertain. The routines they relied on dissolved overnight, replaced by remote work and a constant undercurrent of anxiety. Housing prices in Massachusetts were soaring beyond reason, each listing snapped up by cash buyers before they could even schedule a viewing. It felt like they were chasing a moving target with no hope of catching up.

Alan had always harbored a dream of owning a small farm someday—a vision of retirement filled with open spaces and the gratifying toil of working the land. Heather, ever practical and rooted in her digital asset management career, was less enamored with the idea but open to possibilities. The pandemic, however, accelerated their timeline in ways they hadn't anticipated.

They began exploring options beyond the confines of their familiar life. Their search took them across states—considering places like Maine and even Ohio at one point. Ohio was quickly ruled out when a promising house was sold before they could visit. Heather wasn't keen on hot climates, and Alan, being from the UK, wasn't particularly drawn to them either. Vermont started to stand out—a place of natural beauty, reasonable distance from their current home, and a climate they could both embrace.

"Look at this one," Alan said, pointing to the screen. "Ten acres, fully wooded, with a mobile home. It's off-grid but has potential!"

Heather raised an eyebrow. "Potential for what? Getting lost in the woods?"

He chuckled. "Perhaps. But think about it—a chance to build something from the ground up. To create the life we've talked about but never dared to chase."

She sighed, a mix of skepticism and intrigue. "I thought that was a retirement plan, not a right-now plan."

"Why wait?" he replied. "The world's changing. Maybe we should change with it."

After several more discussions—some filled with excitement, others laden with doubt—they decided to take the leap. They arranged to visit the property during a short getaway to Vermont. As they turned off the paved road onto a dirt one, the trees seemed to close in around them. Miles passed without a house in sight.

"Are we sure we're on the right road?" Heather asked, her voice tinged with uncertainty.

"According to the GPS, we are," Alan assured her, though he was beginning to question it himself.

Finally, they arrived. The mobile home sat quietly amid the trees, its exterior worn but standing. The generator shed leaned slightly, and the only sounds were the rustling leaves and a distant stream.

Stepping out of the car, the air was different—crisp, clean, and filled with the scent of pine. There was a serenity here that contrasted sharply with the tension they'd been feeling back in Massachusetts.

Heather took a deep breath. "It's... peaceful."

Alan nodded. "It is. And imagine what we could do with it."

They walked the property, envisioning paths they could clear, gardens they could plant, and perhaps a few animals to keep them company. The challenges were evident—no power, overgrown land, a fixer-upper of a home—but so was the allure.

"We don't know the first thing about farming," Heather mused.

"True," Alan admitted. "But we've figured out other things before. And we don't have to know everything right now. We can learn as we go."

Her gaze settled on a shaft of sunlight breaking through the canopy. "It's a big change."

"One that we can make together," he said, taking her hand.

In the days that followed, they weighed the pros and cons. Friends and family had mixed reactions—some supportive, others skeptical. But the more they thought about it, the more it felt like the right move. The traditional path seemed less and less viable, and this unconventional route offered something priceless: autonomy.

They made an offer, navigating the complexities of purchasing property in a pandemic. Ending their vacation early, they returned to Massachusetts to finalize the details.

When the confirmation came that the property was theirs, a wave of emotions washed over them—excitement, fear, hope. They were stepping into the unknown, leaving behind the familiar for a chance at something entirely different.

Heather looked at Alan, a small smile playing on her lips. "Well, I guess we're farmers now."

He laughed. "Not quite yet. But we're on our way."

This is not a tale of easy transitions or expert know-how. We are two people who decided to take a chance, embracing the uncertainties and challenges that come with starting anew. Heather's stack of how-to books grew daily, covering everything from basic carpentry to animal care. Alan's tech background fueled ideas of integrating modern solutions into rustic living, though he knew farming wouldn't be as simple as coding a program.

They anticipated mistakes—plenty of them. They expected moments of doubt and days when they'd question their decision. But they also looked forward to small victories, lessons learned, and the satisfaction that comes from building something with their own hands.

This story is about that journey—the leap of faith, the early days of dreaming and planning, and the steps they're taking to turn a wild piece of land into a home and a farm. It's not a guidebook or a how-to manual. It's an honest account of embracing change, facing fears, and the often messy process of turning dreams into reality.

As they stand on the threshold of this new chapter, they invite you to join them. Share in their experiences—the good, the bad, the humorous mishaps, and the unexpected joys. They're not sure where this path will lead them, but they know it's a story worth telling.

Welcome to their adventure, from the decision that started it all to the countless unknowns that lie ahead. Welcome to Texas Farms.
