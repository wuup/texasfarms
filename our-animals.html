                    <p class="mb-4">The Gloucestershire Old Spot pig is the oldest pedigreed spotted pig in the world. Once popular on small family farms where they were raised on dropped orchard fruit, earning them the nicknames of the "orchard pig" or "cottage pig." This breed is known for being excellent foragers, attentive mothers, and their gentle temperaments.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">The richly marbled meat has a depth of flavor that is completely unmatched. It's no surprise this breed is the favorite of the British Royalty!</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">We sell feeder piglets as well as registered GOS breeding stock. See the farm store for pricing on half and whole shares as well as individual retail cuts.</p>
