When people visit our farm, the rabbits always get attention. There's something about those silvery coats that catches the eye.

We raise Champagne D'Argent rabbits—one of the oldest rabbit breeds in the world—and we think they're perfect for small-scale, sustainable meat production.

## An Ancient Breed

Champagne D'Argent rabbits originated in the Champagne region of France (yes, where the wine comes from). French monks were breeding these rabbits as early as the 1600s, making them one of the oldest documented rabbit breeds.

They were prized for two things: their luxurious silver pelts and their excellent meat. For centuries, they were a staple of French monasteries and small farms.

## The Silver Transformation

Here's what makes these rabbits unique: they're not born silver.

Champagne D'Argent kits are born jet black. Over the first few months of life, they gradually develop their signature silver coat. The transformation starts around 4 weeks and is complete by 5-6 months.

It's one of nature's more remarkable color changes, and it never gets old watching the kits silver out.

## Why Rabbits for Meat?

Rabbits are one of the most sustainable meat animals you can raise:

- **Efficient feed conversion** — Rabbits convert feed to meat more efficiently than almost any other livestock
- **Small footprint** — You don't need acres of pasture
- **Quick turnaround** — Rabbits reach market weight in 10-12 weeks
- **Gentle on the land** — Their manure is garden gold and doesn't need composting
- **Quiet** — Unlike roosters or pigs, rabbits won't disturb the neighbors

For homesteaders with limited space, rabbits make a lot of sense.

## Why Champagne D'Argent Specifically?

We chose this breed for several reasons:

**Temperament** — They're calm and docile, easy to handle even for beginners.

**Mothering** — Does are attentive mothers with consistent litter sizes.

**Meat quality** — Fine-grained, mild-flavored meat with excellent dress-out percentages.

**Heritage genetics** — By raising a rare breed, we're helping preserve genetics that might otherwise be lost.

## Getting Started

If you're interested in raising your own meat rabbits, Champagne D'Argent are a great choice for beginners. They're hardy, forgiving of mistakes, and productive.

We sell breeding stock throughout the year—junior bucks, junior does, and proven breeders. All our rabbits come with pedigrees and we're happy to share what we've learned.
