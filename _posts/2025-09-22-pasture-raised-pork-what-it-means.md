Walk through any grocery store and you'll see labels everywhere: "natural," "farm fresh," "humanely raised." Most of it is marketing nonsense with no legal definition.

So what does "pasture-raised" actually mean? And why should you care?

## The Factory Farm Baseline

To understand pasture-raised, you need to understand what it's replacing.

The vast majority of pork in America comes from Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs). In these facilities:

- Pigs live their entire lives indoors on concrete
- Breeding sows are confined to gestation crates so small they can't turn around
- Animals never see sunlight or touch soil
- Growth is maximized through genetics, feed, and pharmaceuticals
- The entire operation is optimized for efficiency, not animal welfare or meat quality

This is how cheap pork happens. It's also why supermarket pork tastes like nothing.

## What Pasture-Raised Means

Pasture-raised is the opposite of confinement. On our farm:

- **Pigs live outdoors** — They have access to pasture, woodland, and open air
- **They forage** — Roots, grass, acorns, windfall fruit—pigs are omnivores and they eat like it
- **They move** — Walking, running, rooting, exploring. Pigs are intelligent, curious animals and they need stimulation
- **They express natural behaviors** — Wallowing in mud, building nests, socializing in groups
- **Supplemental feed** — We provide grain and other feed to ensure complete nutrition, but it supplements forage rather than replacing it

## Why It Matters for Meat Quality

Pasture-raised pork tastes different. Here's why:

**Exercise develops muscle** — Pigs that move have more developed muscles with better texture.

**Varied diet creates complexity** — A pig eating grass, roots, nuts, and grain has meat with more depth of flavor than one eating the same commercial feed every day.

**Slower growth concentrates flavor** — Our pigs take 8-10 months to reach market weight. Factory pigs are slaughtered at 5-6 months. That extra time means more developed flavor.

**Fat composition changes** — Pasture-raised pigs have different fatty acid profiles. The fat is often softer, more flavorful, and renders better.

## Why It Matters Beyond Taste

Even if you don't care about flavor, there are other reasons to choose pasture-raised:

**Animal welfare** — Pigs are smart, social animals. They deserve better than concrete and crates.

**Environmental impact** — Rotational grazing can improve soil health rather than destroying it.

**Supporting small farms** — Your money goes to a local family instead of a multinational corporation.

**Community connection** — You can visit our farm. You can meet your farmer. Try doing that with a factory operation.

## The Label Problem

Here's the catch: "pasture-raised" isn't a legally regulated term. Anyone can put it on a package.

That's why relationship matters. Buy from farmers you can talk to. Ask questions. Visit if you can. A real pasture-raised operation will welcome your curiosity. A marketing department won't.
