Heritage pork chops don't need much. In fact, the biggest mistake people make is over-complicating things. When you start with well-marbled meat from a pasture-raised pig, simplicity is your friend.

Here's how we cook pork chops at home.

## Start with Room Temperature Meat

Take your chops out of the fridge 30-45 minutes before cooking. Cold meat hitting a hot pan leads to uneven cooking—grey on the outside, undercooked in the middle.

## Season Simply

Heritage pork has flavor that commodity pork can only dream of. Don't bury it under marinades and rubs.

- Kosher salt (generous)
- Fresh cracked black pepper
- That's it

Season both sides and let it sit while the meat comes to temperature.

## Get Your Pan Ripping Hot

Cast iron is ideal. Stainless steel works too. Non-stick won't give you the sear you want.

1. Heat your pan over medium-high for a few minutes
2. Add a high smoke-point oil (avocado, grapeseed) or a mix of butter and oil
3. When the oil shimmers and just barely starts to smoke, you're ready

## The Cook

Place chops in the pan and **don't touch them** for 3-4 minutes. Let the crust form.

Flip once. Add a knob of butter, a few crushed garlic cloves, and some fresh thyme or rosemary. Baste the chops with the herb butter as they finish.

For a 1-inch thick chop:
- 3-4 minutes first side
- 3-4 minutes second side
- Target internal temp: 140°F (will rise to 145°F while resting)

## Rest Your Meat

This is non-negotiable. Move chops to a cutting board and let them rest 5 minutes. The juices redistribute, and you won't lose them all when you cut in.

## That's It

No complicated sauces needed. Maybe deglaze the pan with some cider or white wine if you want a quick pan sauce. But honestly? Well-raised pork with salt, pepper, and butter is hard to beat.

The difference between heritage pork and supermarket pork is never more obvious than with a simple preparation like this. When there's nowhere for bad meat to hide, good meat shines.
